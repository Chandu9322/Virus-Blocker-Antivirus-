A computer virus is a type of malware that infects executables, modifying them to include copies of itself. The first virus, Brain, was created in 1986. Viruses can damage various system components and spread rapidly via the internet. Antivirus detection methods include signature-based detection and code emulation. To evade detection, virus writers create metamorphic viruses that alter their structure while maintaining functionality using techniques like code reordering, dead code insertion, and instruction substitution.
