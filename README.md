A computer virus is a type of malware that infects executables, modifying them to include copies of itself. 
The first virus, Brain, was created in 1986. Viruses can damage various system components and spread rapidly via the internet. 
Antivirus detection methods include signature-based detection and code emulation.
To evade detection, virus writers create metamorphic viruses that alter their structure while maintaining functionality 
using techniques like code reordering, dead code insertion, and instruction substitution.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is an effective statistical pattern analysis tool for detecting metamorphic viruses.
This project explores whether extensive metamorphism can evade HMM. 
A metamorphic engine was developed using obfuscation techniques to generate highly discrete virus copies. 
These morphed copies were tested against HMM, normal files, original viruses, and commercial virus scanners to assess their ability to evade detection.
